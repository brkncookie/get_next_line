# get_next_line
Reading a line on a fd is way too tedious

## Summary
The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor.

Take a look at the [PDF](https://github.com/brkncookie/get_next_line/raw/bain4main/en.subject_8.pdf)

## TODOS

- *rewrite the code and figure out a way to null the lines you return.
- fix the the wierd bugs.
- *implement the functions you need.
- test...test.
- *do the bonus.
- add other test cases (e.g. we if fail to `malloc` or `read`).
- *recode the whole thing.
- write a [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html).
- review->recode->comment.
- implement tests.

*PS: all of the above have been done.*
